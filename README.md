<details>

<summary><i>Open instructions</i></summary>

**Time Estimate**: 35 minutes

## üé¨ What You're Building

You'll implement an advanced pizza discovery system that demonstrates senior Angular skills:

- **Real-time Search**: Debounced search with client-side filtering
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter by diet type (All/Veg/Non-Veg) with state management
- **Advanced Sorting**: Sort by price (Low‚ÜíHigh, High‚ÜíLow), name (A‚ÜíZ)
- **Infinite Scroll**: Load more pizzas on scroll using pagination
- **Order Creation**: Create orders via POST API integration
- **State Management**: Maintain all filter/search/sort state

## üìä Sample Data Context

The database contains ~50 pizzas with these properties:

```javascript
{
  "_id": "...",
  "name": "Margherita",
  "price": 12.99,
  "isVegetarian": true,
  "description": "...",
  "imageUrl": "..."
}
```

## üîß Available Backend API

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/pizzas` - Ready to use, no backend changes needed!

### Query Parameters Available:

- `filter`: `'veg'` | `'non-veg'` | undefined (shows all pizzas)
- `sortBy`: `'price'` | `'name'` | `'createdAt'` (default: 'createdAt')
- `sortOrder`: `'asc'` | `'desc'` (default: 'desc' for newest first)
- `page`: number (default: 1)
- `limit`: number (default: 10)
- `search`: string (searches pizza names)

### Required Response Format:

```json
{
  "pizzas": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "currentPage": 1,
    "totalPages": 5,
    "totalCount": 45,
    "hasNextPage": true,
    "hasPreviousPage": false,
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

### Order Creation API:

```bash
# Create order endpoint
POST /api/orders
Authorization: Bearer <token>

# Body example:
{
  "items": [
    { "id": "pizza1", "name": "Margherita", "price": 12.99, "quantity": 2 }
  ],
  "deliveryAddress": "123 Main St, City, State 12345",
  "totalAmount": 25.98
}
```

## üé® Angular Frontend Implementation

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

**You'll know it's working when:**

1. Filter buttons change the displayed pizzas correctly
2. Sort dropdown reorders pizzas by price
3. Scrolling to bottom loads more pizzas automatically
4. Loading states show during API calls
5. "No more pizzas" message appears at the end

## üß™ Quick Verification

1. Start with "All" filter, "Default" sort (newest pizzas first)
2. Click "Veg" - only vegetarian pizzas display (still newest first)
3. Change sort to "Price: Low to High" - cheapest veg pizzas first
4. Click "Non-Veg" - only non-vegetarian pizzas, cheapest first
5. Change to "Price: High to Low" - most expensive non-veg pizzas first
6. Scroll down - more pizzas load automatically

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Gotchas

- Remember to reset to page 1 when filters/sort change
- Handle empty results (no veg pizzas found)
- Prevent duplicate API calls during scroll
- Clear previous results when changing filters
- When no `veg` parameter is sent, show all pizzas (don't filter)
- Default sort should be newest pizzas first (createdAt desc)

## üîó API Examples

```bash
# Get all pizzas, newest first (default)
GET /api/pizzas?page=1&limit=10

# Get all pizzas sorted by price (cheapest first)
GET /api/pizzas?sortBy=price&sortOrder=asc&page=1&limit=10

# Get only vegetarian pizzas, most expensive first
GET /api/pizzas?veg=true&sortBy=price&sortOrder=desc&page=1&limit=10
